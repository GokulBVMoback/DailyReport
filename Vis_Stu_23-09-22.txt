>Debug Mode vs Release Mode
	*Debug and Release are different configurations for building your project. 
	*As the name implies, you generally use the Debug mode for debugging your project, and the Release mode for the final build for end users. 
	*The Debug mode does not optimize the binary it produces (as optimizations can greatly complicate debugging), and generates additional data to aid debugging. 
	*The Release mode enables optimizations and generates less (or no) extra debug data.

						Debug Mode						Release Mode
#Priority of build mode			*When we are developing the application.        *When we are going to production mode or deploying the application to the server.
#Code Optimization			*The debug mode code is not optimized.		*The release mode code is optimized.
#Performance				*In debug mode the application will be slow.	*In release mode the application will be faster.
